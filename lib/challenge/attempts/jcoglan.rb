  # The following machines compute the function:
  #
  #     f(n) = the smallest k such that 2^k > n
  #
  # This is the same as ceil(log(n+1, 2)), which is the number of digits in the
  # binary representation of n.

  # V1: 5 states, 3 symbols, 15 rules
  # ---------------------------------
  #
  # This solution is a straight transcription of the following process, with a
  # state for each step:
  #
  #   1. Initialize a counter to the left of the input
  #   2. Scan right until we find an input digit, and replace it with a marker
  #   3. Increment the counter
  #   4. Scan back through the counter to reach the input; goto 2
  #   5. Clean up trailing markers
  #
  #Â Say we begin with input 14, or 1110 in binary. The tape then looks like
  # this:
  #
  #      1  1  1 [0]
  #
  # The function ceil(log(n+1, 2)) is the number of digits in the binary
  # representation of n, so the machine needs to count the digits in the input.
  # It will search for each digit in the input and each time it finds one, it
  # will increment a counter somewhere else on the tape.
  #
  # The first step (state 1) is to initialise the counter. We place this to the
  # left of the input, because it will grow to the left. State 1 involves
  # scanning to the left until we hit a blank:
  #
  #         1  1  1 [0]
  #         1  1 [1] 0
  #         1 [1] 1  0
  #        [1] 1  1  0
  #     [ ] 1  1  1  0
  #
  # When we hit a blank in state 1, we write a 0 for the counter, then move
  # right and enter state 2.
  #
  #      0 [1] 1  1  0
  #
  # In state 2, we scan right until we find a non-marker symbol. If we see a 0
  # or 1, we replace it with a marker, move left and enter state 3. (Machine
  # state is listed on the right.)
  #
  #      0 [1] 1  1  0      |   2
  #     [0] -  1  1  0      |   3
  #
  # State 3 is the incrementor. When we see a marker, we just move left. When
  # we see a 0 or blank, we replace it with 1 and we move to state 4. If we see
  # a 1, we write a 0 and keep moving left to carry the addition. On our
  # example this is brief:
  #
  #     [0] -  1  1  0      |   3
  #      1 [-] 1  1  0      |   4
  #
  # The purpose of state 4 is to move rightwards again through the counter
  # until we find the markers. On all symbols it moves right, but on markers it
  # moves to state 2. From there it can search for the next digit and increment
  # the counter again.
  #
  # Following this process once more around the loop, we see the following
  # sequence of tape and machine states:
  #
  #         1 [-] 1  1  0     |   4
  #         1  - [1] 1  0     |   2
  #         1 [-] -  1  0     |   3
  #        [1] -  -  1  0     |   3
  #     [ ] 0  -  -  1  0     |   3
  #      1 [0] -  -  1  0     |   4
  #      1  0 [-] -  1  0     |   4
  #      1  0  - [-] 1  0     |   2
  #
  # After a two more turns around this loop, we end up with this on the tape:
  #
  #      1  0  0  - [-] -  -
  #
  # All the digits have been counted, and state 2 will begin scanning right
  # again. But now, it will hit a blank before any digits.
  #
  #      1  0  0  -  -  -  - [ ]
  #
  # This switches the machine to the final state (5). This state just replaces
  # markers with blanks and moves left, and halts on all other symbols.
  #
  #      1  0  0  -  -  - [-]
  #      1  0  0  -  - [-]
  #      1  0  0  - [-]
  #      1  0  0 [-]
  #      1  0 [0]
  #
  # Now the machine halts, with the result value and no markers left on the
  # tape.
